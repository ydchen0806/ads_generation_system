- **Atmosphere:** Professional and focused, emphasizing the product's use in a serious gaming environment.

#### **Keyframe 2:**
- **Camera Position:** The mouse is now floating above a vibrant, colorful digital landscape.

### **Transition Details:**

1. **Camera Movement:**
   - **Dolly Out:** Begin with a slow, deliberate dolly out from Keyframe 1, moving away from the hand and mouse. This will gradually reveal more of the monitor's surroundings.
   - **Pan Up:** As you dolly out, pan up slightly to include the top edge of the monitor, giving context to the environment.
   - **Zoom In:** Once the monitor is fully visible, perform a subtle zoom-in towards the mouse, bringing it back into focus while the background blurs further.

2. **Visual Effects:**
   - **Fade Out/In:** Apply a soft fade-out from Keyframe 1, transitioning smoothly into the new scene.
   - **Morph Effect:** Use a morph effect where the mouse smoothly transforms into its floating state, maintaining its shape and details.
   - **Parallax Blur:** Apply a gentle parallax blur to the monitor and background, creating depth and making the transition feel more dynamic.

3. **Element Interaction:**
   - **Mouse Transition:** The mouse should appear to float upwards and outwards, as if being lifted by a force field or magical energy.
   - **Color Shift:** The mouse retains its original color scheme but becomes more vibrant and saturated as it enters the new scene.
   - **Lighting Change:** The blue glow from the monitor transitions into a warmer, more inviting light as the mouse is lifted.

4. **Timing and Pacing:**
   - **Duration:** The entire transition should last approximately 3-4 seconds.
