**Transition Description:**

**Scene Change:**
From a serene outdoor setting with a bag of Lay's Classic chips hanging from a tree branch to a cozy indoor environment where the same bag of chips rests atop a stack of vintage books.

**Camera Movement:**
- **Dolly In:** Begin with a slow, steady dolly-in towards the bag of Lay's Classic chips in the first scene. The camera should move smoothly, maintaining focus on the product while gradually bringing it closer to the viewer.
- **Pan Left:** As the dolly-in continues, simultaneously pan the camera slightly to the left, revealing more of the lush green foliage in the background. This movement will help establish the outdoor setting before transitioning into the next scene.
- **Zoom Out:** Once the camera has moved close enough to the bag, begin a gentle zoom-out, slowly pulling back to reveal the entire stack of books beneath the bag. This will help transition the viewer from the close-up of the product to its placement within the scene.

**Visual Effects:**
- **Dissolve Transition:** As the camera zooms out, implement a subtle dissolve effect. This will seamlessly blend the outdoor scene with the indoor scene, creating a smooth transition without abrupt cuts.
- **Light Leaks:** Introduce a soft, warm light leak effect to enhance the transition. This can be achieved by adding a gentle, warm glow around the edges of the frame, which will help the viewer perceive the change in setting more naturally.

**Interaction Between Elements:**
- **Bag of Chips:** The bag of Lay's Classic chips remains the focal point throughout the transition. Ensure that it stays sharp and clear, maintaining its prominence in the frame.
- **Books:** The stack of vintage books serves as a natural bridge between the two scenes. As the camera pans and zooms, the books will become more prominent, subtly shifting the viewerâ€™s attention from the outdoor environment to the indoor setting.

**Timing and Pacing:**
- **Duration:** The total duration of the transition should be approximately 3-4 seconds.
- **Acceleration/Deceleration:** Start with a slower pace during the initial dolly-in and pan, gradually increasing the speed as the camera zooms out. This will create a sense of anticipation and excitement as the viewer is drawn closer to the product.

**Lighting Changes and Atmosphere Transitions:**
- **Outdoor to Indoor:** The lighting should shift from bright, natural daylight to softer, warm indoor lighting. This can be achieved by adjusting the exposure settings and adding
